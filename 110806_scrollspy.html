        <p>Millions of Americans will vote in the midterm elections on Tuesday, with the balance of power in Congress at stake
            The entire US House of Representatives, about a third of the Senate and key state governorships are up for grabs.
            President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and ex-President Donald Trump, a Republican, made their closing arguments in duelling rallies.

            Mr Biden's ability to pass laws will be stymied if Republicans take the House, as most projections expect.

            While Mr Bidenmself is not up for re-election on Tuesday, midterms are often seen as a referendum on a president's leadership
            Despite delivering on promises to lower prescription drug prices, expand clean energy and revamp US infrastructure, Mr Biden has seen his popularity suffer following the worst inflation in four decades, record illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border, and voter concerns about crime
            The vote looms - so who will win Congress? He went to Maryland on Monday night to campaign for Wes Moore, who is expected to make history as the third black governor ever elected in the US.</p>
